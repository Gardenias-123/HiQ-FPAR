# HiQ-FPAR
The High-Quality Fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (HiQ-FPAR) is derived from reprocessed MODIS FPAR C6.1 product by SpatioTemporal Information Compositing Algorithm (STICA). This method integrates information from multiple dimensions, including pixel quality information, spatiotemporal correlation, and original observations, to improve the raw MODIS FPAR retrievals with poor quality. The HiQ-FPAR covers the period from 2000 to 2023 year, with spatial resolutions of 500m/5km for global vegetation area and temporal resolutions of 8 days.

The HiQ-FPAR product file name follows certain naming convention, providing useful information about a specific product. More details can found in DataDescriptionForHiQFPAR.docx, and data read examples can also be viewed in this file.
